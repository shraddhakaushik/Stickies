# CPSC210 Personal Project

## Sticky Notes Application

The concept that I am choosing to pursue for my *CPSC 210* personal project is that of a **sticky
note software** with numerous useful features that give the user control over their virtual sticky notes.
As a student, my laptop's inbuilt Stickies application is one that I use for nearly everything; whether it is to 
note down reminders, a to-do list, note down my thoughts, or work out my day's schedule, the app is always so 
convenient.

However, there are certain things that the desktop app does not do that I would find really useful in such a software, 
so 
I will be instead creating my own sticky note application with features that I think would make the app incredibly 
useful to me,
as well as to other students and professionals working centrally with their computers.
